Mockplant is a powerful API mocking tool that allows you to create and manage mock servers for testing and development purposes. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating imposters (mock endpoints) and recording API responses.

## Features

- Create and manage mock servers (imposters)
- Record real API responses and convert them to mock endpoints
- Support for various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Flexible request matching with predicates
- Customizable response headers and body
- Dark/Light mode support
- Responsive design for all devices

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Modern web browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanyam-malik/MockPlant
cd mockplant
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker Installation

Alternatively, you can run Mockplant using Docker:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. To stop the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

4. To view logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

The container will automatically restart unless explicitly stopped.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python mockplant_http.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost
```

> **Note:** The project comes with some example imposters in the `imposters` folder that you can use as reference or starting points for your own mock endpoints.

### Creating an Imposter
